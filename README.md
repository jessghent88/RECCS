This repository includes notes and files used during a Research Experience for Community College Students (RECCS) program at the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the summer of 2018.

*As you conduct research this summer, use this file to log what you did each day and keep track of your current top and secondary priorities. Over time these priorities will change, shrink, grow, etc. When this file changes substantially (at least once a day) commit the changes using git and at the end of each day push the changes to the GitHub remote repository. Obviously you should also revise the Goals section to include any additional priorities you have.*

*Feel free to add sections as well. This is part of your digital field notebook, so you should change it to meet your needs.*

Top Priorities
--------------
1. Build June 18 dense cloud.

8. Export practice Agisoft model to a Sketchfab model for RECCS blog.

Secondary Priorities
--------------------

1. Conduct literature review related to uncertainty analysis in Structure from Motion. A good place to start is to use Web of Science to look at the papers cited by and that have cited the Reitman and Cook papers.
