This repository includes notes and files used during a Research Experience for Community College Students (RECCS) program at the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the summer of 2018.

*As you conduct research this summer, use this file to log what you did each day and keep track of your current top and secondary priorities. Over time these priorities will change, shrink, grow, etc. When this file changes substantially (at least once a day) commit the changes using git and at the end of each day push the changes to the GitHub remote repository. Obviously you should also revise the Goals section to include any additional priorities you have.*

*Feel free to add sections as well. This is part of your digital field notebook, so you should change it to meet your needs.*


General Goals
=============

General scientific practice
---------------------------
1. Linux and the command line.

2. Git for version control.

3. Digital analysis note taking and reproducible scientific workflows.

4. Scientific literature review.


Agisoft Photoscan
-----------------
1. Gain a general understanding of the theory behind Structure From Motion.

2. Gain ability to use Agisoft Photoscan as a graphic user interface

3. If time permits, learn to use Agisoft Photoscan through python scripts.


Field Observation
-----------------
1. Conduct fieldwork with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).

2. Practice making field observations.


Description of Research Project
===============================

*As you conduct the research project, you'll fill this out.*


Weekly Activities
=================

Week 1: June 4-8, 2018
----------------------
Training with RECCS Staff

Week 2: June 11-15th
--------------------

1. Monday

    a. Got set up on GitHub and GitKraken.

    b. Created repository with this summer's notes in it on GitHub and pushed this file to GitHub. Command line instructions are [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).

    c. Introduction to the computer I'll be working on and where the files are.

    d. Introduction to Agisoft PhotoScan.

    e. Did the [Commonmark Markdown Tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/).

    f. Uploaded photos from ChalkCliffs_20180608.

    g. Watched the [Cultural Heritage Imaging video tutorials](https://vimeo.com/channels/practicalphotogrammetry) on best practice for taking images.

    h. Agisoft exercise using office items.

    i. Moved computer. Set up at my desk.

    j. Met with Katy and Greg. Created a plan for this week.

2. Tuesday

    a. Watched Zoom webcasts. Coastal Change at Sandwich, Mass and Sparse Cloud Editing & Optimization.

    b. Completed markers in Agisoft from ChalkCliffs_20180509.

    c. Read Sketchfab model blog post.


Priority List
=============

Top Priorities
--------------
1. Work through the [command line, git, and python lessons from CSMDS](https://csdms.github.io/2018-05-21-csdms/).

2. Practice making Agisoft models using scale bars. Refer to the [3D Model Reconstruction](http://www.agisoft.com/pdf/PS_1.1%20-Tutorial%20(BL)%20-%203D-model.pdf) and the [Scale Bar Placement](http://www.agisoft.com/pdf/tips_and_tricks/CHI_Calibrated_Scale_Bar_Placement_and_Processing.pdf).

3. Participate in Greg's Thursday meeting with colleagues.

4. Export practice Agisoft model to a Sketchfab model for RECCS blog.

5. Watch Wednesday's Zoom webcasts.

Secondary Priorities
--------------------

1. Construct and write about proposed sets of Ground Control Points.

2. Conduct literature review related to uncertainty analysis in Structure from Motion. A good place to start is to use Web of Science to look at the papers cited by and that have cited the Reitman and Cook papers.
