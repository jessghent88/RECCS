This repository includes notes and files used during a Research Experience for Community College Students (RECCS) program at the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the summer of 2018.

*As you conduct research this summer, use this file to log what you did each day and keep track of your current top and secondary priorities. Over time these priorities will change, shrink, grow, etc. When this file changes substantially (at least once a day) commit the changes using git and at the end of each day push the changes to the GitHub remote repository. Obviously you should also revise the Goals section to include any additional priorities you have.*

*Feel free to add sections as well. This is part of your digital field notebook, so you should change it to meet your needs.*
